Overview
This repository hosts code files for a course that explores the inner workings of large language models (LLMs). The material outlines core mechanisms, from the foundations of neural networks to the behavior of modern systems and the practicalities of working with them in real projects. The goal is to give learners a solid mental model of how LLMs operate, how to reason about their outputs, and how to build reliable, responsible systems around them.

The course treats language models as a chain of concepts rather than a single black box. You will learn how data flows through a model, how attention shapes results, and how losses guide training. You will also study prompts, decoding choices, alignment methods, evaluation techniques, and deployment considerations. By the end, you should be comfortable reading research papers, translating ideas into code, and evaluating AI behavior with discipline.

What you will learn
- The core building blocks of transformer-based LLMs
- How attention mechanisms enable long-range dependencies
- The role of tokens, embeddings, and positional encoding
- Training objectives used in large-scale language modeling
- How decoding strategies (greedy, beam search, sampling, nucleus sampling) affect outputs
- Prompt engineering principles and practical prompt patterns
- Alignment, safety, and guardrails in real systems
- Evaluation methods for language models, including qualitative and quantitative measures
- Techniques for fine-tuning, adapters, and retrieval-augmented approaches
- Methods to measure reliability, bias, and failure modes
- Practical considerations for deploying LLMs in apps and services
- Best practices for reproducibility, documentation, and collaboration
